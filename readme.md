"Crow Game"
C21471486 Kacper Lysakowski

In this game you play a crow who has to collect crow bucks. You pick up slices of bread which increases your crow bucks.
If you are too fast, you will get fined crow bucks.
Watch out! There are other crows, who also want your bread!

I learned that crows are very smart and chill creatures.
The simulation does not feature crows flapping their wings, which they do in reality.

The crows are boids who follow a path.
Once bread spawns, the crows rush to it using seeking behaviour.

Music came from the youtube audio library.
