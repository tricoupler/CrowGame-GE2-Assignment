I learned that crows are very smart and chill creatures.
The simulation does not feature crows flapping their wings, which they do in reality.

The crows are boids who follow a path.
Once bread spawns, the crows rush to it using seeking behaviour.

Description of the project

In this game you play a crow who has to collect crow bucks. You pick up slices of bread which increases your crow bucks.
If you are too fast, you will get fined crow bucks.
Watch out! There are other crows, who also want your bread!

To run this game, you can use the .exe file provided (if you are on windows).

What I am most proud of in the assignment

I am most proud of the overall feel of the game. I like how there is a consistent soundscape to the game, and I like how it plays well with the mechanics of the game.

What I learned
I learned how to fully create a game with artifical life simulation in Godot. I learned how to procedurally make a creature that is realistic in just short lines of code.
