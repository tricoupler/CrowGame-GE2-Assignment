I learned that crows are very smart and chill creatures.
The simulation does not feature crows flapping their wings, which they do in reality.

The crows are boids who follow a path.
Once bread spawns, the crows rush to it using seeking behaviour.

Description of the project

In this game you play a crow who has to collect crow bucks. You pick up slices of bread which increases your crow bucks.
If you are too fast, you will get fined crow bucks.
Watch out! There are other crows, who also want your bread!

To run this game, you can use the .exe file provided (if you are on windows).

What I am most proud of in the assignment

The best part of the assignment was the camera rotation. It looks very cool and I like how it helps everything come together. This combined with the statue and skybox helps bring about a cool synthwave aesthetic. The nodes are 3D spheres which rotate with the camera.
What I learned
I learned how to rotate objects around a point in Godot. This is a great technique that makes a project look great. I also learned how to generate 3D models with generative AI. The model was very vertex and face intensive, so it had to be decimated several times before being put into the project. Furthermore, there is a texture on the statue, but it is not very effective. Nevertheless, it was great to learn how textures work in game engines.
